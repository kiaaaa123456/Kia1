        <h5>Student Of SMKN 1 CIANJUR</h5>
        <p>
          Hi My name is Sazkia, I am a novice Developer and also a Designer. I am a student of SMKN 1 CIANJUR majoring in RPL and now I am in class X.
          Many things have changed in me after entering one of my favorite schools in Cianjur, at this school I learned a lot from discipline, how to behave properly and correctly and many other things. many people say this school is a school that can be said to be a fairly strict school, and it is true. but when we've enjoyed it will feel ordinary even very fun.
          Being able to enter this school was one of my dreams, and it was finally achieved. Happy? Of course, I was very, very happy, there were many difficulties in the process of selecting new students to enter this school, but that did not stop me from trying so that in the end I was at the point I wanted. With so many moments I've been through, it's something I can't forget. Of course, in the happiness that I get, of course there are prayers and efforts from my parents who always accompany my steps.
